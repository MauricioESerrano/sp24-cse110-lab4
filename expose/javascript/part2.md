It will print '3', since var allows it to be used outside
It will print '150', since thats the final price calculated
It will print '150', since thats the final price pushed
It will print [50, 100, 150 ], since that is the edited array
It errors out since i is not defined in the scope of the function.
It errors out since discountedPrice is not defined in the scope of the function.
It will print '150', it will print the price at the top
It will print [50, 100, 150 ], since the contents are edited in the if statement
It errors out since i is not defined in the scope of the function.
It will print '3', since it computed it first


It will print '[ 50, 100, 150 ], since the contents within const can be changed.
A. student.name B. student['Grad Year'] C. student.greeting() D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name E. student.courseLoad[0] 13. A. 32, since it adds as if strings (concatination) B. 1, since - is referred to as arithmetic C. 3, since null is 0 for numbers D. 3null, since null is just a string E. 4, since true is equal to 1 F. 0, false is 0 and so is null G. 3undefined, since it is treated as a string H. NaN, since undefined is not defined and errors it out. 14. A. true, since > refers to both of them as numbers B. false, since this seen as characters, and 2 is bigger than 1. C. true, since it turns 2 into a string making them equal D. false, since it just checks for their value and type, which differs E. false, since the boolean is turned to a number and 1 != 2 F. false, since === checks for value and type, of which the values are true but types are different. 15. == tries to coerce before comparing, matching them to the same type. === on the other hand, just compares the values and types, and if not both are the same it doesn't return true. 16. Code.. 17. It will print [2, 4, 6], since the newArr is pushed values of the returned value of doSomething, which doubles the input integer. Since this is performed across the entire array, it will return all values doubled. 18. Code... 19. It will print 1 4 3 2, since 1 is instantly printed, 2 has a delay on it, 3 has a shorter delay, and 4 is instantly printed.
